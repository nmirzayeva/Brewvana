This is a coffee application developed in Android Studio using **Kotlin**. The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture to ensure clean code and efficient UI updates. Key features include:

- **Firebase**: Used for user authentication (Email/Password) and real-time storage of coffee items and special offers.
- **Glide**: Seamless image loading and caching for coffee images.
- **LiveData**: Observes data changes and updates the UI in real time.
- **RecyclerView**: Efficient and responsive list display for coffee items and offers.

## App Features:

- **Explore a Wide Variety of Coffees**: Browse through an extensive list of coffee types, including espressos, cappuccinos, lattes, and more.
- **Detailed Coffee Information**: Each coffee item comes with a detailed description, including its origin, flavor profile, and strength level, allowing users to make informed choices.
- **Customize Your Coffee**: Choose the size (small, medium, large, extra large) of your coffee and customize it further with milk, sugar, or flavor shots.
- **Add to Cart**: Easily add your selected coffee and preferences to the cart, and it is ready for checkout.
- **View Special Offers**: Stay updated with the latest promotions and offers available for various coffee items, helping you get the best deal.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Using Firebase, all coffee items and offers are updated in real-time, ensuring users always see the latest menu options.
